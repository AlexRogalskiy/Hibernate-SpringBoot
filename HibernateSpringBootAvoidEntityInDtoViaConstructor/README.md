**[Avoid Entity In DTO Via Constructor Expression (no association)](https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootAvoidEntityInDtoViaConstructor)**
     
**Description:** Let's assume that we have two entities, `Author` and `Book`. There is no materialized association between them, but, both entities shares an attribute named, `genre`. We want to use this attribute to join the tables corresponding to `Author` and `Book`, and fetch the result in a DTO. The result should contain the `Author` entity and only the `title` attribute from `Book`. Well, when you are in a scenario as here, it is strongly advisable to avoid fetching the DTO via *constructor expression*. This approach cannot fetch the data in a single `SELECT`, and is prone to N+1. Way better than this consists of using Spring projections, JPA `Tuple` or even Hibernate `ResultTransformer`. These approaches will fetch the data in a single `SELECT`. This application is a **DON'T DO THIS** example. Check the number of queries needed for fetching the data. In place, do it as here: [Entity Inside Spring Projection (no association)](https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootDtoEntityViaProjectionNoAssociation).
