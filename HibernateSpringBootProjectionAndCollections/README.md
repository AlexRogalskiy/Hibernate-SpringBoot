**[Pay Attention To Spring Projections That Include Associated Collections](https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootProjectionAndCollections)**

**Description:** This application inspect the Persistent Context content during fetching Spring projections that includes collections of associations. In this case, we focus on a `@OneToMany` association. Mainly, we want to fetch only some attributes from the parent-side and some attributes from the child-side. 

**Key points:**
- nested projections fetches data in Persistent Context as well
