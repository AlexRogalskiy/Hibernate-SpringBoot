**[Ordering The Set Of Associated Entities In @ManyToMany via @OrderBy](https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootManyToManySetAndOrderBy)**

**Description:** In case of `@ManyToMany` association, we always should rely on `Set` (not on `List`) for mapping the collection of associated entities (entities of the other parent-side). Why? Well, please see [Prefer Set Instead of List in @ManyToMany Relationships](https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootManyToManyBidirectionalListVsSet). But, is well-known that `HashSet` doesn't have a predefined entry order of elements. If this is an issue then this application relies on `@OrderBy` which adds an `ORDER BY` clause in the SQL statement. The database will handle the ordering. Further, Hibernate will preserve the order via a `LinkedHashSet`.

This application uses two entities, `Author` and `Book`, involved in a lazy bidirectional many-to-many relationship. First, we fetch a `Book` by title. Further, we call `getAuthors()` to fetch the authors of this book. The fetched authors are ordered descending by name. The ordering is done by the database as a result of adding `@OrderBy("name DESC")`, and is preserved by Hibernate.

**Key points:**\
     - ask the database to handle ordering and Hibernate to preserve this order via `@OrderBy`\
     - this works with `HashSet`, but doesn't provide consistency over all transition states (e.g., over transient state)\
     - for consistency over transient state as well, consider using explicitly `LinkedHashSet` instead of `HashSet`

**Note:** Alternatively, we can use `@OrderColumn`. This gets materialized in an additional column in the junction table. This is needed for maintaining a permanent ordering of the related data.
