**[How @ElementCollection With @OrderColumn Works](https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootElementCollectionWithOrderColumn)**

**Description:** This application reveals the performance penalties of using `@ElementCollection`. In this case, with `@OrderColumn`. But, as you can see in this application, by adding `@OrderColumn` can mitigate some performance penalties when operations take place near the collection tail (e.g., add/remove at/from the end of the collection). Mainly, all elements situated before the adding/removing entry are left untouched, so the performance penalty can be ignored if we affect rows close to the collection tail.

**Key points:**\
     - an `@ElementCollection` doesn't have a Primary Key\
     - an `@ElementCollection` is mapped in a separate table\
     - pefer `@ElementCollection` with `@OrderColumn` when you have a lot of inserts and deletes from the collection tail\
     - the more items are inserted/removed from the beginning of this table the greater the performance penalty
